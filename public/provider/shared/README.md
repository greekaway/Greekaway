# Provider Shared Assets

This folder contains shared UI fragments (header, footer, modals, loaders) for the modular provider panel.

Guidelines:
- Keep purely presentational snippets (HTML partials) here.
- Global JS utilities remain in `provider.js`.
- Page-specific logic lives in `provider-<page>.js`.
- Shared CSS stays in `provider.css` and `provider-footer.css`.
