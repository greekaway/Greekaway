REPLACE_THIS_FILE_WITH_THE_APPLE_DEVELOPER_MERCHANTID_DOMAIN_ASSOCIATION_FILE_PROVIDED_BY_STRIPE

# How to get the correct file:
# 1. In the Stripe Dashboard go to Settings -> Payment methods -> Apple Pay (or search "Apple Pay").
# 2. Add/verify a new domain and Stripe will offer a downloadable file named
#    "apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association" with the exact bytes required.
# 3. Replace the contents of this file with the downloaded file's raw contents.
# 4. Deploy to Render so the file is available at:
#    https://<your-domain>/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association
# 5. Back in Stripe click "Verify" for the domain. If successful, Apple Pay is enabled for that domain.

# Important: the association file must match exactly (no extra newlines or comments).
# Do NOT keep this placeholder in production; use the exact file from Stripe.
