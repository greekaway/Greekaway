      "title": "SECTION 2 – Small Groups. Real Journeys.",
      "body": "Our experiences are made for small groups of 5–7 travelers — just enough for company, but still personal.\nEvery trip runs on fixed dates to keep costs low and quality high.\nWhether it’s a drive through mountain villages, a night by the sea, or a visit to an ancient site, each moment is planned with care, balance, and respect for the land and the people who host you."
    },
    "s3": {
      "title": "SECTION 3 – Partners, Not Providers",
      "body": "Behind every Greekaway experience there’s a partner — not a vendor.\nDrivers, hotels, and local operators are part of the same system, treated fairly and paid transparently through our automated dual-payment network.\nThis balance keeps our ecosystem sustainable, honest, and focused on long-term value, not short-term profit."

      "title": "SECTION 4 – The Technology Behind the Human Touch",
      "body": "Greekaway uses technology quietly — to make things smoother, not colder.\nOur AI assistant answers travelers live, shows real availability, updates weather and news, and ensures that each group forms naturally through a matching algorithm that blends traveler profiles, ages, and languages.\nThe result is something rare in tourism: human journeys, enhanced — not replaced — by technology."

    "s5": {
      "title": "SECTION 5 – Transparency, Simplicity, Evolution",
