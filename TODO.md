TODO

- [ ] Add full focus-trap to overlays (tab should cycle inside modal)
- [ ] Improve accessibility: aria-hidden on background when modal open; ensure focus is restored to trigger element on close
- [ ] Add profile and checkout pages (optional): /profile.html, /checkout.html
- [ ] Integrate real payment provider (Stripe/PayPal) on /checkout.html with secure server-side handling
- [ ] Consider centralizing overlay manager into a small JS file and include it where needed
- [ ] Run cross-device QA (iOS Safari, Android Chrome, Desktop) and adjust CSS if needed
- [ ] Add integration tests for overlays (puppeteer)
